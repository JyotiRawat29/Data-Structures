Problems where you always choose the best at every step are called Optimization Problem. These are the problems that want minial or maximal solution.
In order to solve optimisation problem, we use:
  a. Greedy Method
  b. Dynamic Programming
  c. Branch and Bound

Greedy Method:
a = 1,2,34,5,3 n = len(a)

Greedy_Algo(a,n):
  for i in n:
    x = select(a):
      if feasible(x):
         solution = solution + x // + means involving x in the solution like adding another best mango in the basket
